# Atomic Design Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing the **Atomic Design methodology** to create and analyze UI components and design systems. The goal is to understand how UI libraries are structured and to practice developing reusable components for real-world applications.

---

## Key Concepts
1. **Atomic Design Methodology**:
   - Breaking down UIs into fundamental building blocks:
     - **Atoms**: Basic elements such as buttons, icons, or input fields.
     - **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms functioning together, like a search bar.
     - **Organisms**: Groups of molecules forming distinct sections, such as a navigation bar.
     - **Templates**: Frameworks for page layouts.
     - **Pages**: Complete screens with real content.

2. **Material Design**:
   - Analyzing the order of layers in UI screens and understanding visual hierarchies.

3. **Design System Creation**:
   - Building cohesive libraries for specific themes or brands by defining colors, typography, components, and multistate elements.

## Tasks Completed
### **1. Atomic Design Analysis**
- Snapshots were taken from **Alibaba**, **Booking.com**, **EasyJet App**, and **Interrail** to identify and categorize:
  - One **Atom**
  - One **Molecule**
  - One **Organism**
  - One **Template**

---

### **2. Material Design Layering**
- Using a snapshot of Lyft screens, the visual hierarchy was analyzed, and layers were ordered numerically to understand the stacking context.

---

### **3. Design System Exploration**
- A library of UI elements was recreated based on the **EasyJet design system**, including atoms, molecules, and organisms.

---

### **4. Climbing Group Rebrand**
- A moodboard was created with pictures, colors, and typography reflecting the climbing theme.
- A design system was developed with:
  - Atoms, molecules, and organisms.
  - Multistate components for interactivity and variations.

---

### **5. Dating App Design**
- A moodboard was composed with romantic, vibrant colors and typography.
- A complete design system was built, featuring components tailored for a dating app UI.

---

## Tools & Resources
- **Figma**: Used to create moodboards, design systems, and analyze UI elements.
- **Noun Project**: Source of icons for UI components.
